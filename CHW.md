# ContraBot CHW Dashboard — Roles & Setup

The CHW app (`chw/`) helps community health workers run anonymous contraception consults, claim digital referrals from WhatsApp/web, and log outcomes. Supervisors get a district analytics view. There is **no password auth** in this MVP — role is chosen at onboard.

---

## Roles

| Role | What they see |
|------|----------------|
| **CHW** | New consult, outcomes, follow-ups due, open referral queue, claim → consult |
| **Supervisor** | District outcome analytics, referral counts, no new-consult entry |

On first open, set:

- Name
- Role (`chw` or `supervisor`)
- District
- **CHW ID** (required for CHW role; attached to outcome logs)

Profile is stored in browser `localStorage` only.

---

## Field workflow

1. **New consultation** — enter anonymous client profile → WHO MEC recommendation + talk scripts.
2. **Log outcome** — accepted / method / follow-up (including schedule date) / notes.
3. Outcomes are saved locally **and** synced to `POST /api/outcomes` (offline: local save still works).
4. **Follow-ups due** — Home lists outcomes with scheduled/pending follow-up in the next 7 days.
5. **Session View** — open a past session for age group, method, duration, notes, referral code.

Average session time uses real `started_at` / `ended_at` timestamps.

## Digital referrals (WhatsApp + web)

Referrals are **anonymous**. No client phone numbers are stored long-term in SQL.

| Source | How |
|--------|-----|
| Web | **Talk to a CHW** — optional live handoff (consent + WhatsApp number) or code-only |
| WhatsApp | **Talk to CHW** → consent → bot notifies CHW → user gets code |
| CHW | Home queue → **Contact client** (24h link) / **Claim** |

For the full live-handoff design, see [CHW_HANDOFF.md](CHW_HANDOFF.md).

API:

- `POST /api/referrals` — create code-only referral
- `POST /api/handoffs` — consent-based live handoff
- `GET /api/referrals?district=&status=open` — queue
- `GET /api/referrals/{id}/contact` — short-lived `wa.me` link
- `PATCH /api/referrals/{id}` — claim / complete

---

## Environment

`chw/.env`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_USE_MOCK=false
VITE_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=2547XXXXXXXX
```

- `VITE_USE_MOCK=true` — demo without backend (mock recommend / referrals / analytics).
- `VITE_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` — powers **Message ContraBot on WhatsApp** on the dashboard.

Run:

```bash
cd chw
npm install
npm run dev
# http://localhost:5174
```

Backend should be running (`uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`) when mock is off.

## Privacy notes

- Consult forms do not collect client names or phone numbers.
- Outcome + referral rows store district, method interest, CHW ID, anonymous session/referral codes only.
- WhatsApp codes are meant to be spoken/shown in person so a CHW can match the client without server-side phone linkage.
